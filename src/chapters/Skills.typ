Whereas Attributes represent innate ability, Skills reflect behaviors learned and honed over a lifetime. These are things that could be practiced or learned from a book.

Skills serve as the second of the three Prime Sets used in every roll, rated from #spec_char.d4 to #spec_char.d12.

Similarly to Attributes, Skills are divided into Mental, Physical, and Social categories.

== Mental Skills
== Academics
Higher education and knowledge of the arts and humanities. It covers language, history, law, economics, and related fields. Many magi develop aptitude in Academics to further their research into the Mysteries.

*Suggested Specialties:* Anthropology, Art History, English, History, Law, Literature, Religion, Research, Translation.

== Awareness
You've got uncanny perceptions. While alert folks spot everyday clues, your instincts cue in on the so-called supernatural side of life. Perhaps you've simply got that feeling about things -- some people do, even if they're not Awakened as such. More likely, you've spent enough time around the magical world to sense its effects in your presence.

At lower levels, this Skill grants a nebulous perception of uncanny phenomena; higher ratings in the Trait reveal auras, expose the secretive Night-Folk, and open your eyes to the spiritual Periphery.

*Suggested Specialties:* Omens, Auras, Resonance, Weird Feelings, Mystic Instincts, Hidden Magic, Spiritual Vidare.

== Computer
Advanced ability with computing. While most characters in the World of Darkness are expected to know the basics, the Computer Skill allows your character to program computers, to crack into systems, to diagnose major problems, and to investigate data. This Skill reflects advanced techniques and tricks; most people in the modern world can operate a computer for email and basic Internet searches.

*Suggested Specialties:* Data Retrieval, Graphics, Hacking, Internet, Programming, Security, Social Media.

== Crafts
Knack with creating and repairing things. From creating works of art, to fixing an automobile, Crafts is the Skill to use.

*Suggested Specialties:* Automotive, Cosmetics, Fashion, Forging, Graffiti, Jury-Rigging, Painting, Perfumery, Repair, Sculpting.

== Esoterica
Esoteric knowledge comes in many forms: astrology, angelography, fortune-telling, yoga, herbalism, demonology, the lore of stones, even the secret code languages of occult societies. For centuries, such mysteries were the province of selected initiates; these days, it's relatively easy to find the basics in any decent bookstore or website. Even so, the deeper levels remain obscure to all but the most devoted students of the art. Anyone can take a yoga class in the modern world, but the more arcane applications of that art demand years of practice, study, and devotion.

Esoterica Knowledge reflects your pursuit of esoteric disciplines and, by extension, provides instruments for your magickal focus. The Skill's overall rating reflects your general knowledge of arcane subjects, whereas each specialty reflects your expertise within a certain field. Unlike the Occult -- which reflects an understanding of “secret history” and shadow-cultures -- Esoterica represents the practical application of unusual fields. Occult can teach your character who Aleister Crowley was, while Esoterica helps her understand what Crowley did… and to use those principles herself.

Given an opportunity to study and practice an art, any character can learn Esoterica. Although such disciplines don't give magickal powers to unAwakened characters, the Knowledge lets them use mundane applications -- teaching yoga classes, doing horoscopes, deciphering alchemical texts and so forth. Understanding the principles of bakemono-jutsu -- the ninja “ghost technique” -- won't make you invisible, for instance, but a specialty in that esoteric technique would let you add it to your Stealth Skill rolls.

*Suggested Specialties:* Yoga, Tantra, Herbalism, Kabbalah, Fortune-Telling, Hypnosis, Astrology, Celestiography, Demonology, Sacred Geometry, Gematria, Goetia, Prophecies, Omens, T'ai Chi, I Ching, Stone Lore, Alchemy, Symbolism, Transhumanist Theory, Esoteric Musicology, Bakemono-Jutsu, Iconology, Numerology, Voodoo, Crystalmancy, Tarot, specific arcane languages (Enochian, In-o-Musubi, the Language of Flowers, etc.).

== Investigation
Skill with solving mysteries and putting together puzzles. It reflects the ability to draw conclusions, to find meaning out of confusion, and to use lateral thinking to find information where others could not.

*Suggested Specialties:* Artifacts, Autopsy, Body Language, Crime Scenes, Cryptography, Dreams, Lab Work, Riddles.

== Medicine
Knowledge of the human body, and of how to bring it to and keep it in working order. Characters with Medicine can make efforts to stem life-threatening wounds and illnesses.

*Suggested Specialties:* First Aid, Pathology, Pharmaceuticals, Physical Therapy, Surgery.

== Occult
Knowledge of things hidden in the dark, legends, and lore. While the supernatural is unpredictable and often unique, the Occult Skill allows your character to pick out facts from rumor. Almost all magi develop at least some aptitude in Occult, to further their studies of the Mysteries.

*Suggested Specialties:* Neopaganism, Occult History, Conspiracy Theories, Secret Societies, New Age, Alternative Sciences, Mystic Lore, Folk Magic, Moral Panic, Urban Legends, Satanic Folklore, Pop-Culture Satanism, Actual Satanism, any specific occult discipline or field (Freemasonry, Voodoo, Stage Magic, etc.).

== Politics
General knowledge of political structures and methodologies, but more practically shows your character's ability to navigate those systems and make them work the way she intends. With Politics, she knows the right person to ask to get something done.

*Suggested Specialties:* Bureaucracy, Church, Consilium, Democratic, Local, Order, Organized Crime, Scandals.

== Science
Knowledge and understanding of the physical and natural sciences, such as biology, chemistry, geology, meteorology, and physics.

*Suggested Specialties:* Almost any hard scientific field.

=== Scientific Specialties
Common “respectable” Science variations practiced by Awakened characters include, but are not limited to, the following potential specialties:

- *Aeronautics:* Design, construction, and operation of aircraft and other flying machines.
- *Astronomy:* Study of stellar bodies, celestial mechanics, and outer space.
- *Biology:* Research into the mysteries within Earth's organic life forms.
- *Biopsychology:* Tracing (and often altering) the interplay between a living being's physical state and its psychological state.
- *Chemistry:* Deciphering and manipulating the chemical codes within Earthly substances.
- *Computer Science:* IT system languages, logistics, theory, advancement, and implementation.
- *Cybernetics:* Research, development, and implementation of interconnected organic matter and machines.
- *Electronics:* Harnessing and exploring the potential of electronic energies and devices.
- *Engineering:* Design, research, and construction of essential structures. Engineering has many variations; if there's a structure involved in a project, then there's an engineering discipline involved in creating and maintaining that structure.
- *Forensic Pathology:* Reconstructing evidence from scattered and fragmented clues.
- *Genetics:* Research, analysis, and manipulation involving the literal “building blocks of life.”consider this a soft science, those who manipulate identity, memory, and behavior find it extremely useful.
- *Geology:* Study of earthly formations, materials, and phenomena.• Psychology: Study of human consciousness and behavior, and their related therapies.
- *Hypermathematics:* Esoteric, arcane, theoretical, and sometimes absurd applications of advanced mathematical principles, often tied to the links between science, faith, and magick.
- *Psychopharmacology:* Research, development, and applications dealing with the interplay between psychoactive substances and human/humanoid consciousness, perceptions, and behavior.
- *Mathematics:* Study of equations, numbers, patterns, and the interplay between them.
- *Psychoprojection:* Research into the multiple disciplines and effects of extraphysical consciousness co- and re-location. In plain English, the study of astral projection, multiple selves, and travel into the Digital Web.
- *Metallurgy:* Research, refinement, and implementation involving the properties and functions of various metallic substances, alloys, and compounds... though not, unfortunately, musicians.
- *Paraphysics:* “Proper” name for Dimensional Science, also known as the interrelationship between Earthly reality and the Otherworlds.
- *Phylogeny:* Study of transition and transformation, their effects, and the potential uses of both.
- *Physics:* Observations and research regarding the interrelationships between matter and energy. Theoretical physics deals with potential but currently unproven models of physics, whereas practical physics deals with known applications of established physics.
- *Psychodynamics:* Study and application of human and humanoid mental processes -- specifically the relationships between emotional responses, mental health, physical state, and outward behavior. Although some Technocrats
- *Sociobiology:* Observation and manipulation of societies as extended organisms -- composed of individual beings -- that nurture, protect, and reproduce themselves.
  By researching the tendencies of such organisms, sociobiologists strive to understand and influence societies... and the individuals within them.
- *Xenobiology:* Study, analysis and understanding of alien organisms: monsters, spirits, mythic beasts, and other things conventional science does not currently accept as real.

Radical scientists -- Etherites, Ecstatics, Virtual Adepts, and even some maverick Technocrats, among others -- have dozens, perhaps hundreds, of other disciplines, ranging from Etherdynamics to Chaos Math to Coprophrenology (don't ask...). Naturally, such sciences are not generally accepted by the community at large; this, of course, just inspires their proponents to prove how true their theories really are...
