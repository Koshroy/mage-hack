Attributes represent raw ability and essential traits every character possesses.

== Using Attributes
Attributes are the second PC's three primary trait sets, so they are to be used in every roll, as any action can fall into one of these areas: mental, physical and social, and a specific situation determines which exact attribute will be used.

Attributes serve as the second of the three Prime Sets used in every roll, rated from #spec_char.d4 to #spec_char.d12.

The nine Attributes are split into three categories: Physical, Social, Mental.

== Rating Attributes
Attributes usually have a rating from #spec_char.d6 to #spec_char.d10, although there are exceptions.

/ #spec_char.d4 Poor: Notably deficient in this area.
/ #spec_char.d6 Typical: An average degree of ability.
/ #spec_char.d8 Excellent: Above-average performance.
/ #spec_char.d10 Remarkable: Greatly above average.
/ #spec_char.d12 Incredible: Peak levels of ability.
