== Signature Assets
In Mage, Signature Assets represent your social connections, special equipment, status in Sleeper or Awakened society,
special arcane knowledge, Sancta etc, so almost anything that is not innate to your character but is important to them.

== Dropping Assets
At any point during the scene a player can choose to lose a Signature Asset narratively justifying it. In that case you
gain XP equal to the price of the Signature Asset lost.
