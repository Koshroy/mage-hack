A conveniently prepared spell, a friend in the right office or a perfectly practiced gunplay trick, mages are a crafty bunch, able to find advantages in the moment or prepare for virtually any situation using their numerous unusual skills and magickal powers. These beneficial circumstances are represented through assets. Assets are narratively significant traits that improve your chances of influencing a story to your benefit.

Giving an object a die rating by creating an asset means that this object is a significant part of the story. Most objects in the game are color, setting, or flavor rather than an asset; if it's something that exists in the story, something the Storyteller or players are using as part of their description, then it should be a part of narrating the outcome of a test or contest, but it doesn't confer any more dice.

  == Using assets
  During play, a player can add as many of their fictionally appropriate assets to a dice pool as they'd like. Since they spent a #spec_c.pp to create the asset, there's no need to spend another to use it.
]

Assets belong to the character of the player that created them, and by default can't be included in anyone else's pool. An asset created to help another character belongs to that character and can't be used by the creator's character. Spend an additional #spec_c.pp to declare an asset to be open and usable by any character in the scene, including GMCs.

Assets --- also called temporary assets when they need to be distinguished from signature assets --- last until the end of the scene, unless something in the story makes them no longer relevant, or they're stepped down or eliminated.

The player may spend an additional #spec_c.pp to keep the asset around through to the end of the session.

  == Creating Assets
  There are several ways for players to create assets during play:
]

- A player can spend a #spec_c.pp and create a #spec_c.d6 asset with a name they come up with.

- Some SFX allow for stunts—assets that start with a #spec_c.d8 die rating.

- A player can create an asset greater than #spec_c.d6 and without spending a #spec_c.pp by making a test.

- When the narrative situation calls for it, the Storyteller may declare that a #spec_c.d6 asset is created for free as part of a successful test that wasn't made explicitly to create an asset.

  === Test-Created Assets
  To create an asset by attempting a test, a player declares what their character does to create the asset and assembles an appropriate dice pool. The Storyteller rolls to set the difficulty, usually with something basic like #spec_c.d6#spec_c.d6.
]

The effect die of the test becomes the die rating of the asset. The Storyteller may set a cap on the size of assets created this way by setting the difficulty dice to that die rating. The asset created may not be larger than this die cap.

  === Clues As Assets
  Anytime a PC wants to get a read on somebody, case a scene, spot something out of the ordinary, or generally just use their senses, they're creating an asset.
]

The Storyteller usually calls for the roll, though it's just as valid for a player to ask for it. The difficulty for an asset test is set by rolling a straight #spec_c.d6#spec_c.d6 --- unless the Storyteller decides otherwise. A player's dice pool for the test is assembled from appropriate traits.

With a successful test, the PC gains some crucial information. If the PC spends a #spec_c.pp after succeeding at the test, they can bank the asset until they need it, give it to another character, or keep it for longer.

With a failed test, the PC doesn't gain any useful advantage. If there are complications, they generally represent the consequences of poking around places trying to find stuff out.

  == Signature Assets
  Signature assets are assets that have become permanent traits for a character, playing an ongoing and essential part in their story. Usually, they cover anything that gives you an advantage and isn't covered by your other trait sets.

]

Note that your signature assets do not include all of your character's gear or other advantages. When something is an asset, it just means that it's so important to your character's story that you gain an extra die when using it.

Most signature assets break down into one of five categories: items, creatures, places, people, and rotes. Example signature assets for each category are listed below.

*Things* are the most common form of signature asset, including items or equipment that you own, carry, or have access to. Examples include #smallcaps[Magic Carpet], #smallcaps[1971 Dodge Challenger], #smallcaps[Universal Translator], #smallcaps[My Family's Heirloom Sword], #smallcaps[Handheld Medical Scanner], #smallcaps[Chainsaw], #smallcaps[Laser Pistol], etc.

*Creatures* include pets, mounts, animal companions, familiars, and the like. Examples include #smallcaps[Armored Warhorse], #smallcaps[Well-Trained Bloodhound], #smallcaps[My Cat Snowball], #smallcaps[Ornery Camel], #smallcaps[Baby Dragon], #smallcaps[Tamed Pterodactyl], #smallcaps[Pocket Monster], etc.

*Places* represent advantages gained from being in or having knowledge of a certain location. Examples include #smallcaps[Seaside Hideout], #smallcaps[Private Library], #smallcaps[Special Forces Bar], #smallcaps[Pocket Dimension], #smallcaps[Hidden Glade], #smallcaps[PANIC ROOM], #smallcaps[MY Queen's Palace], #smallcaps[My Uncle's Army Surplus Store], #smallcaps[Satellite Hq], etc.

*People* are minor GMCs who can be relied upon to help you, at least occasionally. Examples include #smallcaps[My Squire], #smallcaps[Robot Bodyguard], #smallcaps[Mob Informant], #smallcaps[Hairy Alien Co-Pilot], #smallcaps[Kid Sidekick], #smallcaps[Psychic Little Sister], #smallcaps[Wizard Mentor], #smallcaps[Fence Who Doesn't Ask Questions], etc.

*Rotes* are magickal effects that were practiced to the point of expertise and come naturally. Examples include #smallcaps[Creo Fulmen], #smallcaps[Videte Per Materiam], #smallcaps[Telekinesis], #smallcaps[Intellego Magica], #smallcaps[Aurelius' Minor Combat Adjustments], etc.


#block(breakable: false)[
  === Using Signature Assets
  A signature asset belongs to a PC and is recorded on their character file --- it doesn't need to be created during play and it gives the player an extra die to include in their dice pools when they can justify their use. Unlike skills or attributes, signature assets are about things a PC has or people they know, not about qualities innate to them. These assets are a great way to further reveal a PC's personality as a means of representing heirlooms, signature rotes or unique weapons or special relationships.
]

Signature assets can be temporarily knocked out, eliminated, rendered unusable, or damaged during play; but as they're a featured element of the PC's character file, the player can recover the signature asset between sessions or by spending a #spec_c.pp at the beginning of the next scene (with some narrative justification for getting it back/fixed).


#block(breakable: false)[
  === Rating Signature Assets
  Signature assets begin with a #spec_c.d6 die rating but can be stepped up during play. They aren't tied to a distinction, attribute, or skill, but may complement any one of those traits. The die rating of your signature asset represents how much the asset can help you, as well as your own bond with it.
]

- #spec_c.d6 Something helpful and everyday, or that you've grown accustomed to.

- #spec_c.d8 Something special and interesting, or that you have a strong connection to.

- #spec_c.d10 Something rare and potent, or that you are defined by.

- #spec_c.d12 Something truly unique and powerful, or that transcends even your innate abilities.


#block(breakable: false)[
  === Signature Assets And SFX
  Some assets may be as simple as a die rating, but on some players can unlock SFX. There are no default SFX for signature assets, so a conversation with a Storyteller about appropriate options should be had before an SFX is added.
]


#block(breakable: false)[
  === Sharing Signature Assets
  A signature asset is made up of two things: your connection to something, and the something you're connected to. The die rating belongs to your connection, not to the thing itself. You and another character might both possess a signature asset, but at different die ratings.
]

Signature assets cannot be shared between PCs; if someone “borrows” a signature asset from a character (picking up the other character's heirloom sword, driving their custom sports car or referencing their grimoire), the borrower must spend a #spec_c.pp to create an asset as normal to get any benefit from the asset borrowed, and the asset is rated at #spec_c.d6 like any other #spec_c.pp created asset.


#block(breakable: false)[
  === Dropping Signature Assets
  At any point during the scene a player can choose to lose a signature asset narratively justifying it. In that case you gain XP equal to the price of the signature asset lost.
