# Introduction
This is a conversion of Mage the Ascension roleplaying game, based mostly on the 20th anniversary edition of Mage.

<!-- # Primer

The game assumes a basic knowledge of Mage: the Ascension lore, but the basic premise is something like this:

Reality is not fixed, but rather a set of agreed upon assumptions enforced by the collective will of humanity, the Sleepers. Mages are those people who recognize that reality is not static, and realize that through the application of their will, usually channeled through rituals or other similar "mystical" or "scientific" practices, reality can be changed.

The specifics of their own belief, called a Paradigm, guides them into joining either one of the nine mystical Traditions (an ancient fellowship of mages of varying points of view), one of the five conventions of the Technocracy (an organization founded at the beginning of the age of reason to bring science and truth to humanity), or to strike out on their own as Disparates (unaffiliated mages), Marauders (mages whose paradigm has overwhelmed their sense of reality), or Nephandi (mages seeking to destroy or corrupt the world).

The central theme of Mage is the search for Ascension, not only for the individual but for all of mankind. What Ascension is, and how it is achieved is purposely left undefined.

## Traditions

A Tradition is a group of mystically-oriented mages allied with the Council of Nine Mystic Traditions. That is, they believe in magic and understand that they manipulate magic to create desired effects. This contrasts with scientifically-oriented mages, who believe that they use Enlightened Science rather than magic, and this Science is manipulated to create desired effects. The Traditions' counterparts among the Scientists of the Technocratic Union (and in an earlier age, the Order of Reason) are called Conventions.

Each Tradition claims a seat on the Council of Nine, representing one of the Spheres of magic. That Sphere is that Tradition's speciality, called an affinity Sphere. Within each tradition exist sub groups that may specialize in different Spheres, so an affinity Sphere may depend not only on the character's affiliation but also his sect.

Although the Council did not technically exist until 1466, many Traditions count their origins to much earlier periods, as they existed as discrete magical societies. Many other Traditions are created from the joining of several disparate groups; as such, their formal creation may be fairly recent, but their component factions may have existed far earlier.

The traditions are:

- **Akashayana/Akashic Brotherhood:** Masters of mind, body, and spirit through the Arts of personal discipline. Affinity Spheres: Mind or Life;
- **Celestial Chorus:** Sacred singers who give a human Voice to the Divine Song. Affinity Spheres: Prime, Forces, or Spirit;
- **Cult of Ecstasy/Sahajiya:** Visionary seers who transcend limitations through sacred experience. Affinity Spheres: Time, Life, or Mind;
- **Dreamspeakers/Kha’vadi:** Preservers and protectors of both the Spirit Ways and the Earthly cultures that have been looted, abandoned, and oppressed. Affinity Spheres: Spirit, Force, Life, or Matter;
- **Euthanatoi/Chakravanti:** Disciples of mortality who purge corruption and bring merciful release from suffering. Affinity Spheres: Entropy, Life, or Spirit;
- **Order of Hermes:** Rigorous masters of High Magick and the Elemental Arts. Affinity Spheres: Forces;
- **Society of Ether/Sons of Ether:** Graceful saviors of scientific potential. Affinity Spheres: Matter, Forces, or Prime;
- **Verbena:** Primal devotees of rough Nature and mystic blood. Affinity Spheres: Life or Forces;
- **Virtual Adepts:** Reality-hackers devoted to rebooting their world. Affinity Spheres: Correspondence/Data or Forces; -->

<!-- ## Arete
Arete is the measure of a mage's enlightenment and understanding of the fundamental truths of reality. It represents the mage's ability to perceive and manipulate the Tapestry, the fabric of the universe, through the use of magic. Arete is both a philosophical journey and a practical tool, essential for the practice of magic.

In the world of _Mage: The Ascension_, magic is not merely a collection of spells and rituals; it is a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. Arete reflects a mage's progress along this path of enlightenment. As a mage advances in Arete, they gain a deeper insight into the nature of reality, allowing them to bend it to their will with greater ease and precision. -->
