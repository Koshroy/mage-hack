All Magi Possess True Magick, though alternative names for the trait set are possible (Spheres, Enlightened Science, Ars Magia).

True Magick consists of 9 Spheres, each governing a fragment of the Tapestry. And each Sphere is ranked #spec_char.d4 to #spec_char.d12, representing the depth and intricacies of the mage's understanding of it, and therefore their power to control it.

== Sphere Rating
All magick is codified into practices based on practitioners mastery over a Sphere, the Practices are:

== Initiate  #spec_char.d4
*Perception:* An initiate grasps the essential principles and begins to perceive the ways in which that Sphere behaves. The mage can't alter anything just yet, but she can put her observations to good use. 

== Apprentice #spec_char.d6
*Manipulation:* The mage begins to use the Sphere to make small alterations in her local reality.  The mage begins to use the Sphere to make small alterations in her local reality.

== Disciple #spec_char.d8
*Control:* Achieving a greater level of accomplishment, the mage can make notable changes to elements connected with the Sphere. Remarkable feats become possible, and the mage approaches the realm of true wizardry.

== Adept #spec_char.d10
*Command:* An impressive command of the Sphere in question allows the mage to perform dramatic feats.

== Master #spec_char.d12
*Mastery:* Magnificent feats become possible with such dominion within the Sphere.  Literally godlike miracles greet the master of a Sphere, and Reality literally shapes itself to her whim.

== Correspondence
_Connections and Dimensions_

By manipulating the ties between places, objects, and people, the Correspondence Sphere allows a magus to sidestep distances, sense things that would normally be out of range, pull objects out of thin air, levitate or fly, or connect an Effect to some other place or character. Some magi proclaim this Sphere is proof that distance is an illusion, whereas others view it as the Art of pulling strings between different places and people. 

Most Effects require touch or close contact, but Correspondence lets the magus reach across distances and affect hidden or faraway targets. Tenuous connections require several successes, but spanning close connections is easy for a magus who understands this Art.

On its own, Correspondence allows the magus to reach across distances, even to places she cannot see or touch. At Rank #spec_char.d6 or higher, she can grasp items and work with them from a distance. To manipulate other objects or beings in ways other than physical contact, however, that magus must combine Correspondence with another Sphere -- typically a Pattern Sphere (Forces, Life, or Matter). 

Despite its ability to warp space and distance, Correspondence deals only with whole Patterns, unless a target has been altered by another Pattern Sphere; Correspondence alone, for example, cannot teleport someone's head off -- the magus would need to use Life magick to separate the head from its body. A gun, on the other hand, could be snatched away by a Correspondence/Matter Effect. 

Mages who specialize in Correspondence tend to have a faraway look. To them, the separations of space and form are meaningless illusions that disappear when you understand how the universe truly fits together.

=== #spec_char.d4 Immediate Spatial Perceptions / Landscape of the Mind
Basic spatial understanding allows a magus to sense things in her immediate vicinity even if she cannot perceive them with her normal senses. Using that perception, she can estimate the distances between objects; intuitively find a direction (North, South, East, West); notice hidden objects or characters; and spot spatial instabilities -- warps, anomalies, wormholes, etc. -- especially the ones caused by other Correspondence Effects. 

=== #spec_char.d6 Sense, Touch, Thicken & Reach Through Space / Correspondence Sensing
That magus can now extend her senses across intervening space, sensing things in other locations. Such extensions, however, leave minor ripples in space… the kind noticed by Rank #spec_char.d4 Correspondence. Fortunately, she can also thicken space to cover her tracks.

By adding Life or Matter to Rank #spec_char.d6 Correspondence, the magus can grasp small items or organisms (housecat-sized or smaller) and then pull them through tiny holes in space. This lets her snatch business cards, guns, rabbits, and such from another location, apparently pulling them out of nowhere. 

=== #spec_char.d8 Pierce Space / Open or Close Gates / Co-locality Perceptions
Now the magus can tear holes in space, large enough for her to step through. These minor gates are small and temporary, but they allow that character to step from one place to another, so long as she is alone and is lightly encumbered. (Teleporting large items, or while carrying heavy loads, demands Correspondence #spec_char.d10.) Scoping out the new location is a good idea, of course. A close, familiar destination is easier than a distant, unfamiliar one.

Using the Co-locality Perceptions Effect, the magus can also perceive several places at once. Those locations all appear as ghosts overlapping each other, as if they had been layered on top of the closest location. 

In addition, by combining Correspondence #spec_char.d8 with Forces, Life, or Matter, the magus can move things around from a distance, levitating, manipulating or teleporting them without physical contact. 

=== #spec_char.d10 Rend Space / Ward / Co-locate Self
Creating larger holes in space, the magus can now open permanent gates between locations; isolate forces, spaces, objects, or people into their own tiny realms (by combining Correspondence #spec_char.d10 with Forces, Life, Mind, or Matter); and ward certain locations against specific Patterns (again, combining Forces, Life, Mind, or Matter with Correspondence) or Resonance energies (combining this Sphere with Prime #spec_char.d10). This warding effect can impede or even block the forbidden elements from crossing into, or out of, the protected space. (For extensive details about wards, see the sourcebook How Do You DO That?)

Using the Co-location Effect, magus can also appear in several different places at once. To function, however, she must add Mind #spec_char.d4 to that Effect. Each self mirrors the original's actions unless she also adds Life #spec_char.d6 to that Effect, granting independence to every self. 

=== #spec_char.d12 Spatial Mutation / Co-Location
Distance and dimensions become child's play to a magus at this Rank. She can distort space; alter sizes and stretch or compress objects (Matter), bodies (Life), or forces (Forces); connect different Patterns to one another across intervening space; or even superimpose places or objects on top of one another (extremely vulgar). Combining this Rank with Life #spec_char.d8, the magus may also expand her senses to perceive many different places at once. 

== Entropy
_Chance and Mortality_

Controlling the energies of probability and decay, an Entropy-schooled magus can manipulate random factors, observe and influence flaws within a system, tap into the energies of the Low Umbra, induce or remove corruption, and otherwise exert his Will through the unpredictable process of chaos.

Entropy describes what should or must happen, but not precisely when or how that result will come about (those are the province of Time). Fate governs blessings, curses, destiny, fortune, oaths, probability, luck, and intent.

This is no easy discipline. The Entropic magus assumes some of the Resonance of decay within his own Pattern, and bears the weight of mortality within his mind and soul. Still, the powers of this Sphere -- though less obviously destructive than those of other Arts -- give that magus subtle but pervasive control over Creation as a whole.

For obvious reasons, Entropy-schooled magi tend to be fatalistic, disassociated, or uncannily cheerful. To them, the saying “all things must pass” is no simple sentiment but an intrinsic fact.

=== #spec_char.d4 Sense Flaws, Fate & Fortune / Ring of Truth
Basic Entropic understanding allows a magus to see the currents of probability, spot flaws in Patterns, and note the subtle yet telling details in a person's speech and behavior that suggest whether or not she's telling what she believes to be the truth. Although they cannot yet control such phenomena, the magus can predict dice throws, card draws, and other apparently random events; spot weak spots in objects, people, or arguments; and use those imperfect yet profound insights to his advantage. 

=== #spec_char.d6 Control Probability
Now the magus can control the factors they could only sense before. Pulling the strings of apparently random events, they can influence activities and results -- directing the fall of dice or cards, repeatedly hitting weak spots, and directing people and things toward a conclusion of his choice. Of course, it is easier to control small events (the winner of a horse race) than large ones (causing a six-car pileup). In game terms, large alterations have higher difficulty than small ones do.

=== #spec_char.d8 Affect Predictable Patterns
Things eventually break down. At this Rank, the magus can control the speed at which material objects fail or decay. That is easier to do with complex machines (cars, computers) than it is with simple ones (walls, stones) -- after all, more things can go wrong with complicated things. 

At this Rank, the magus can also start controlling the fate and fortune of objects and people, giving them good or bad luck by controlling the probability of events around them. Again, large feats have higher difficulty than smaller ones. 

=== #spec_char.d10 Affect Living Things
At this Rank, the magus assumes the awesome power of blessing, cursing, and conferring outright health or decay. By influencing the flow of entropy within a living body, that magus can grant outstanding vitality to, or inflict sudden disease upon, his subject. Such influence may grant long-term luck or misfortune. (GM's option as to how this manifests.) 

=== #spec_char.d12 Affect Thought/ Shape Memes/ Binding Oath
The most esoteric applications of Entropy allow the magus to alter ideas, strengthening or breaking down concepts. Although he does not affect the actual workings of consciousness, he can cause synapses to misfire (thus confusing perceptions and mental processing, inflicting penalties on an enemy's dice rolls), bind someone to an oath, or degrade the patterns of thought. By doing so, that Entropic Master can create, perpetrate, reinforce, and undermine arguments, beliefs, and even memories. 

To do such things, the Master merely speaks to, or glances at, the subject of his attention. Chaos Masters can scramble someone's perceptions with a few weird utterances, and Masters of Order can present arguments with apparently perfect logic. By offering compelling statements, the Master can create or destroy memes, thus influencing whole patterns of belief. An oath, meanwhile, ties the subject's fate to her loyalty; if she breaks the oath, then her luck goes really, really bad. 

== Forces
_Raising Storms_

Although modern physics disputes the old lines between matter and energy, the venerable study of Forces transcends human politics. This Sphere commands the energies of Creation, and its specialists are among the most powerful magi alive.

On a metaphysical level, the Forces Sphere commands energetic Patterns: fire, air, momentum, gravity, radiation, light, sound, and radio waves… the kinetic elements that shape and channel Earthly forces. Quintessence flows within such Patterns, so a magus can conjure new forces simply by adding some Quintessence to “empty space.” Different practices view such powers differently. Are they elemental spirits? Gods? Particles? Waves? Every Master has his or her own pet theory. In practical terms, however, this Sphere controls the Patterns of such forces -- directing, transmuting, enhancing, or banishing their effects upon this world.

Simple manifestations and manipulations are limited to the lower Sphere Ranks, whereas large-scale Effects demand higher levels of expertise. Most large Effects can become Paradox magnets for careless magi. Masters of Forces tend to carry a palpable aura of energetic command, with a Resonance that often alters their environments in uncanny, elemental ways.

=== #spec_char.d4 Perceive Forces
Unlocking basic perceptions of the elements, a Forces-savvy magus can sense the flow of forces in her environment. She can boost her perceptions into the infrared or ultraviolet spectrums, notice electrons, see in the dark, view X-rays, discern the flow of sound or radio waves, spot kinetic energies, and hear frequencies beyond the normal human range. 

=== #spec_char.d6 Manipulate Forces / Elemental Touch
Although she cannot conjure energies just yet, the magus may now alter the flow of existing forces. Sound can be muted or amplified; shadows can be gathered, shaped, or dispelled. The magus can warp light to make things invisible, change their colors by altering the spectrum of localized light, or render them silent by bending sound waves in their vicinity. With a wave of her hand, she can disrupt electrical currents; flare flames; or direct the course of winds, momentum, or gravity.

Combining this Rank with other Spheres, that magus could also make an object (Matter) or organism (Life) attract or repel forces. Thus, she could weave minor protection spells or force fields… or, conversely, turn that target into a magnet (perhaps literally) for the forces in question.

Despite its powers, this Rank is limited in scale. Assume that the magus can command energies around a single human-sized character or within a small area (20' or less). To affect a larger area, you need a higher Rank in Forces. 

=== #spec_char.d8 Transmute Minor Forces / Telekinetics / The Dragon's Touch
Now the magus can alter and invoke the energies she could only touch before. By adding Prime #spec_char.d6, she may conjure winds, fire, electricity, gravitational wells, and so forth. Combining this Rank with Life or Matter, she can transform people into electricity (Life #spec_char.d12/ Forces #spec_char.d8); change water into air (Forces #spec_char.d8/ Matter #spec_char.d8), or attach elemental force to material forms -- making them fly, pinning them to the ground, and having other, similar effects (generally with Life or Matter #spec_char.d8). In addition, by adding an ephemeral Sphere to this Rank, she might erode or enhance energies (Entropy #spec_char.d8); manifest thoughts into energies (Mind #spec_char.d8); transmute spirit-stuff into physical energies (Spirit #spec_char.d8); or set triggers for energy fluctuations at some later interval (Time #spec_char.d10). At this Rank, the scale of effect grows larger, now encompassing several dozen yards or a handful of characters. 

=== #spec_char.d10 Control Major Forces / Gift of Zeus / Weather-Witching
Larger Effects become possible. Our magus may now use the lower-Rank Effects over larger areas -- a mile or more -- to change weather patterns; conjure darkness; drop or raise temperatures; protect locations… or destroy them; and otherwise employ the previous levels on a much greater scale. For obvious reasons, such Effects tend to be vulgar and have higher difficulty to achieve.

=== #spec_char.d12 Transmute Major Forces / Conjuring Infernos
With godlike power, a Forces Master works her Will upon vast areas. She can conjure tornados on a clear day, calm tides, and ignite the very air into a firestorm. Such magi earn the title “Nuke,” though few of them survive long enough to enjoy it. It's easier to invoke such forces under the right conditions, of course -- a cold snap comes more easily in winter than in summer -- and such radical alterations have repercussions that often outlast the original Effect. In game terms, massive Forces spells should disrupt the weather and leave massive Resonance echoes behind.

== Life
_The Living Form_

Life grows, transforming over time until some final incident renders it into inert matter. magi who specialize in Life, therefore, master the complex principles of organic transformation. Beginning with the simplest Patterns, he evolves his understanding toward godlike ends. A true Master, therefore, may end life, but he may also create it from pure energy (that is, from Quintessence) or turn it, literally, to dust.

Whereas other Spheres grapple with abstract theories, Life focuses on literally bone-deep facts. As a Life magus knows, however, those facts remain susceptible to change. In conjunction with other Pattern Spheres (Forces, Matter), life forms can be changed into elements, turned to stone or metal, or else created from such substances. Even without additional Spheres, however, Life allows a magus to transmute those life forms in startling, even apparently impossible ways.

As a whole, this Sphere embraces everything that has living cells within itself, even if that object is technically dead. Generally, assume that anything that is still alive enough to transplant, preserve, or cultivate is governed by Life Arts. If it is inert enough to be irrevocably dead, then it is governed by Matter. Thus, preserved blood and organs, still-living plants, live-culture cheese, and so forth contain Life, but cotton fibers, withered organs, or cut wood become Matter.

An organism that has been radically altered by Life magick (given new limbs or other characteristics that are not part of the creature's original Pattern) suffers Pattern bleeding: an inexorable Quintessence leak that inflicts #spec_char.d6 Hurt stress per day. Unless the caster uses Prime magick to refill that Pattern with fresh energy, or alters that Pattern permanently, the damage continues until the subject dies.

Given their ability to heal illness, age, and harm, Life-skilled magi enjoy great health and vibrant beauty. Truly accomplished ones understand the mutable potential of organic existence and work to correct -- or exploit -- its ever-changing states.

=== #spec_char.d4 Sense Life
Basic Life knowledge allows a person to read the presence and health of nearby life forms. With such knowledge, the magus can discern a living being's age, sex, and overall health. By combining those perceptions with other Spheres, he can also sense distant organisms (Correspondence #spec_char.d6), guess their potential for sickness or misfortune (Entropy #spec_char.d4), perceive them through past or future states (Time #spec_char.d6), or read the streams of Quintessence that bind them to the universe (Prime #spec_char.d4). 

=== #spec_char.d6 Alter Simple Life-Forms / Heal Self
Simple organisms -- viruses, mollusks, insects, plants, etc. -- become clay in the magus's hands. He learns to adjust their Patterns (giving a crab wings, for example), and heal or kill them. Although he cannot yet transmute them into other states of being, he can cause flowers to bloom or wither, help trees bear fruit, and so on. Focusing on his own Pattern, he can also heal himself or perform small alterations (hair color, skin tone, height, weight, and so on) to his basic form. 

=== #spec_char.d8 Transform Simple Life-Forms / Alter Self / Heal Others
Advanced understanding allows the magus to radically alter simple organisms (turning a tree inside out); transform one into another (changing fruit into insects); or -- with Prime #spec_char.d6 -- conjure them from raw energy.

Working with his own Pattern, that magus can work substantial alterations on himself, growing gills, claws, armor and so forth. He remains essentially human, but begins to master the definition of “human.” Meanwhile, he also gains the ability to heal damage to other complex organisms, put them to sleep, or inflict harm upon their living Pattern forms.

=== #spec_char.d10 Alter Complex Life-Forms / Transform Self
At this Rank, the magus may enact radical changes on any complex organism -- people, dogs, horses, and so forth. He can uplift other species with new limbs, opposable thumbs, increased brain capacity, etc., so long as he does not change their intrinsic nature. 
Working with his own Pattern, that magus can transform himself into other life forms of similar size and mass; he could become a Great Dane, for example, but not a hummingbird. The new body might require an adjustment period before the mind and reflexes reflect the new form.

=== #spec_char.d12 Transform & Create Complex Life-Forms / Perfect Metamorphosis
Now the Master of Life may adopt any form he wishes to achieve and may transform other complex organisms the same way. His expertise allows him to make permanent changes to life-Patterns, create complex life-forms from energy (with Prime #spec_char.d6), give them consciousness (with Mind #spec_char.d12), transmute them into other elements (Forces or Matter #spec_char.d8) or raw energy (Prime #spec_char.d12), radically age or de-age them (Entropy #spec_char.d10 or Time #spec_char.d8), or instill them with spirits (Spirit #spec_char.d8 or #spec_char.d12). Without such measures, however, his creations remain mindless, soulless sacks of life -- alive, but nothing more.

== Matter
_Shaping the Materials_

To a mystic, nothing is truly inert. Still, the Sphere of Matter deals with substances that possess no active agency of their own -- materials, not life forms or energies. The third aspect of the Pattern Trinity, Matter works best when combined with other Spheres. Prime and Matter create solid forms from energy; Correspondence and Matter connect objects across space; Entropy erodes or reinforces Matter; Forces transmutes inert elements into active ones. Spirit plus Matter renders ephemera into matter or matter into ephemera. Time alters the temporal state of Matter, and high-Rank Mind Effects (Rank #spec_char.d12) imbue inanimate materials with consciousness. Although Forces, Prime, and Spirit reflect primal energies and Life addresses organic animation, Matter represents the base of the physical world.

Matter-wise magi tend to share a literally hands-on approach to their Art. Solid workers of their practice, they favor practical results with even the most theoretical applications. Sometimes regarded as dull and simple by their more esoteric peers, these artisans merge quality and integrity with surprising levels of ingenuity.

=== #spec_char.d4 Matter Perceptions
A Primary understanding of Matter allows the initiate to perceive the intrinsic properties of base materials -- their underlying structure, innate properties, and integral stability or lack thereof. With that knowledge, she can view the material composition of an object, note its less-obvious structures, find its hidden layers or -- when combining this perception with Entropy -- spot its weak points. Combined with Life, this Sphere detects implants, enhancements, and other integrations of living tissue and inert materials. 

=== #spec_char.d6 Basic Transmutation
With advanced knowledge, the magus can transmute one substance into another, so long as she does not alter its essential shape, temperature, or basic state (gas, liquid, solid). Depending upon that magus's practice, she might reshape lead into gold through alchemy, wood into stone through a hyper petrification process, or water into wine (and, with Life #spec_char.d8, wine into blood) through a sacred miracle. Rare and/ or complex materials are more difficult to fabricate than simple ones; it is easier to turn stone into iron, for example, than into gold.

(On a related note, the magus cannot yet fabricate radioactive materials. Such elements merge their essence into the Sphere of Forces, and thus demand a greater level of expertise.)

When combined with other Spheres, this basic level of understanding allows a magus to conjure base materials from energy or dissolve them into Quintessence (Prime #spec_char.d6); transmute matter into living tissue (Life #spec_char.d10 or higher); move an object through space (Correspondence #spec_char.d6 or higher) or time (Time #spec_char.d8 or higher); change ephemera into matter and matter into ephemera, or awaken the slumbering spirit within material objects (Spirit #spec_char.d8 or higher). In all cases, Matter #spec_char.d6 allows the magus to work with simple, homogenous, non-living substances. Complex mixtures of various elements usually require Rank #spec_char.d8 or higher, although simple combinations (like those found in bread, milk, paper, or gunpowder) are possible albeit more difficult.

=== #spec_char.d8 Alter Form 
At this Rank, the magus can alter the shape of materials in whatever ways she desires, and she can temporarily transform their essential state into a different one -- steel, for example, into fog or water into glass. (Permanent changes require Matter #spec_char.d12.) That crafter may change an item's density, fuse broken pieces together, or rip solid ones apart.

By mixing Matter #spec_char.d8 with other Spheres, the magus can join inert matter with living tissue, disintegrate it into dust, shift objects with the power of thought, or otherwise perform amazing transformations upon apparently solid materials. 

=== #spec_char.d10 Complex Transmutation
Complex and radical transformations now become possible, especially with the addition of other Spheres. Pumpkins can be changed into carriages (Life #spec_char.d6), people into thrones (Life #spec_char.d12), cars into robots (combinations of Forces and Prime), or thin air into banquets, so long as the magus does not mind racking up a little (or a lot…) of Paradox. Different principles can be combined in complicated ways, creating cybernetic machines or electrified gold. Complicated devices (guns, cars, computers) may be conjured out of empty space if the magus understands the principles behind such things (in game terms, possesses the proper Skills). As usual, though, complicated creations demand extended.

=== #spec_char.d12 Alter Properties
With Mastery, the crafter can create substances that transcend the limitations of scientific possibility, conjure materials unknown to Earthly reality, or share the deadly legacies of radioactive matter. Such Masters can shape armor out of air (with Prime #spec_char.d6), turn vampires into lawn furniture (Matter #spec_char.d12), or melt steel with a thought (Mind #spec_char.d8). Again, such deeds remain incredibly vulgar, but they recall the godlike feats of legendry.

== Mind
_Art of Consciousness_

Human beings perceive reality through complex interplays of consciousness. The Mind-mage, therefore, alters the realities of his fellow beings. Skillfully applied, such Arts can make a sane man mad, soothe demented minds, or even shuck the boundaries of flesh.

Though limited in its physical capacities, Mind is the ultimate coincidental Art. Its Effects remain essentially invisible unless they are combined with other Spheres. And although Mind Adepts can leave their physical bodies behind, such abilities remain unseen by mortal eyes.

Drastic acts of mind control (suicide, for instance) have especially high difficulty, as do Mind-based attacks against Night-Folk or other magi with the Mind Sphere. Therefore, weak-willed people may be influenced easily; determined folks can shrug aside the influence of all but the most dedicated Will-workers.

Mind-based Effects are generally coincidental, although especially flamboyant feats might be vulgar instead.

Literally “thought-full,” Mind-savvy magi possess mental clarity and unnerving perceptiveness. Some appear to drift in a sea of distractions, but the majority of them view the world with laser-focus intensity that penetrates illusions to reach their deeper truth.

=== #spec_char.d4 Sense Thoughts & Emotions / Mind Shield / Empower Self
With basic mental magick, the magus learns to sense the emotions and surface impulses of other people. Although he cannot read specific thoughts, he is able to perceive psychic impressions about a person or (with Matter #spec_char.d4) a place or object. Through this perception, he can guess at the nature of weak Resonance signatures and read the stronger ones outright. Even without Resonance, that magus can scan auras, note mood shifts, discern truth from lies, or grasp someone's overall state of mind by way of a successful roll.

Meanwhile, the magus also learns to shield his own mind from the thoughts and emotions of other people, constructing mental barriers around his aura, emotions, and consciousness. 

On a related note, he also learns how to multitask and absorb data with startling acuity. For a scene or two, he can even create a Mind Empowerment asset that concentrates his mental faculties.

=== #spec_char.d6 Read Surface Thoughts / Empathic Bond / Create Impressions / Mental Impulse
Now the magus begins to skim the contents of unshielded minds, discern emotional states, read memories that have been left behind on objects or places, and project single words or emotional impulses to other people. The simpler the emotional content, the easier it is to send or read; a flash of rage, for instance, is easy to project or receive, but the complex stew of reflective melancholy presents a challenge to inexperienced Mind-mages. 

=== #spec_char.d8 Mental Link / Project Illusions / Dreamwalk / Psychic Blast 
With increasing skill, the magus learns to link minds, forge telepathic communications, read or influence another person's thoughts, craft mental illusions, enter someone's dreams and explore dream Realms, and blast psychic assaults into an unwilling rival's consciousness. At this stage, Mind attacks can inflict painful -- though rarely fatal -- damage. Combined with Correspondence, Forces, Matter, or Life, he is able to employ telekinesis, pyrokinetics, and psychophysical assault, influencing objects, elements, or people with the power of his mind. Unlike most other Effects, this sort of thing is not coincidental, although such talents do have a place within popular culture.

=== #spec_char.d10 Control Conscious Mind / Alter Consciousness / Astral Projection
The fearsome power of Black Suits and psychic assailants allows the magus to command another person's actions as well as her thoughts, alter her perceptions or mental state, and project his own mind from his physical form. At this Rank, a magus can change someone's memories, drive her crazy (or sane), overlay her aura with a desired impression, and set up posthypnotic suggestions and commands. In addition, by using internal rather than external powers, he can project his astral form.

=== #spec_char.d12 Control Subconscious/ Forge Psyche/ Untether Consciousness
A true Mind Master commands not only his own conscience but other minds as well. He may alter someone's mind forever, raising (or lowering) her Traits, rewriting her personality, changing her Distinction Trait, or (with Life #spec_char.d10) switching her mind into another body. He can do the same things to his own mind as well, and he can untether that mind to explore the deeper reaches of astral space for hours or even days at a time. His greatest power, though, is the ability to fabricate entire consciousnesses, creating minds where no mind had been before.

== Prime
_Essence of all Things_

By studying the raw energy of Creation, a student of the Prime Sphere learns to understand, manipulate, and absorb the Fifth Essence within all things. Also known as Odylic Force, Primal Energy, and Quintessence, this baseline energy fuels the Patterns of other forms -- Forces, Life, Matter -- and flows through the sublime essence of Spirit. A Prime-skilled magus, therefore, can create and destroy things at their essential level, power items of enchanted or Enlightened creation, and sustain her own life essence through her understanding of Primal Force.

Ripe with such energies, a Prime Sphere specialist pulsates with Primal Force. Unless she is working to suppress it (or has wiped her aura clean with high-Rank magicks), her Resonance bears strong signatures from her deeds. For better and worse, such a person embodies the primal Otherness that most magi possess -- the sense of being something more than most people ever dream of being.

For an optional Technocratic approach to Prime, see Primal Utility, (pp. 526-527).

=== #spec_char.d4 Etheric Senses / Consecration / Infuse Personal Quintessence
A beginning study of Prime allows the magus to perceive and channel Quintessence from Nodes, Tass, Wonders, and magickal Effects. She may spot energetic ebbs and flows, can sense and at least try to read Resonance and Synergy signatures, and could absorb additional Quintessence into her personal Pattern as an asset.

When infusing her Quintessence into an object, that magus may also consecrate the object with her personal energy. When she shapeshifts, steps sideways, or otherwise alters her Pattern's metaphysical nature, that consecrated object will then change with her. In the process, it also picks up her personal Resonance… which, because it both identifies her and becomes essentially connected to her, is not always a good thing. 

=== #spec_char.d6 Fuel Pattern / Construct Patterns / Enchant Patterns / Body of Light
Attaining a degree of control over Prime energies, the magus may divert Quintessence into new or existing forms. Combined with other Spheres, this allows that magus to create new Forces, Life, or Matter Patterns (conjuring them from thin air), and to infuse existing items with Primal Force to strengthen them or enhance their protective or destructive power. 

Weapons or attacks infused with Quintessence through Prime #spec_char.d6 Effects may hurt and substances infused the same way may protect against such harm. On a related note, she may also -- with Life #spec_char.d6 for simple organisms, or Life #spec_char.d8 for complex ones -- consecrate a living thing at this Rank, as if that life form were an object described above. 

Through similar applications of energy, the magus can also conjure a simple Body of Light: an idealized self-projected from ephemeral energy. Although this Body of Light has no substance or special properties (unlike the astral form described in Chapter Nine, p. 477), it presents a glowing holograph of the magus herself. 

=== #spec_char.d8 Channel Quintessence / Enchant Life / Energy Weapon / Craft Periapts & Temporary Wonders 
By tapping into the flow of Quintessence around her, the Prime-skilled magus can draw both free and raw Quintessence from Nodes, Junctures (special times), and Tass (solidified Quintessence)… and she may channel that energy into new and existing Patterns as well. With such powers, she could (with Life #spec_char.d8) pull small amounts of life force from a living sacrifice or (with Matter #spec_char.d6) from inert objects; instill Quintessence into a vessel called a Periapt; or -- with other Spheres -- craft temporary Talismans or Devices by infusing them with Primal Force. 

In desperate circumstances, a Prime-schooled magus can also create temporary weapons out of pure concentrated energy -- blasts of Quintessence or swords of light. Such weapons inflict #spec_char.d6 Quintessence on user per use… or, for weapons that last for a length of time, #spec_char.d6 Quintessence stress per turn. Unless channeled through energy-guns or conjured as miracles among the faithful, such attacks are inevitably vulgar.

=== #spec_char.d10 Expel or Infuse Energy / Tap Wellspring / Craft Tass & Permanent Wonders
The terrible power of draining Quintessence from objects or forces (though not yet from living things) can disintegrate those targets, consume them in Primal flames, or decay them almost instantly. Reversing that flow, the magus can create objects that cannot be broken, or bond organic and inorganic materials together to create cybernetic implants, nanotech, and other Wonders. At this stage, she is able to enchant items permanently and draw Quintessence from the energetic Wellsprings of exciting events. By infusing her personal Quintessence into a Periapt, the magus might use Matter #spec_char.d10 to create a Soulgem - a portable vessel that is filled with her own Resonance and energy. 

=== #spec_char.d12 Infuse or Withdraw Life Force / Create Node & Soulflower / Nullify Paradox
A Prime Master can draw Quintessence from anywhere, at any time, and channel it into other vessels as well. A dark, vulgar aspect of that power allows her to obliterate a living being by consuming all of his life force, whereas the reverse of that power infuses him with life force so strong that he is essentially blessed. Combining that ability with Life #spec_char.d12, she may turn complex organisms into Soulflowers - living Periapts who become walking batteries of boosted Quintessence. Such Mastery also allows the magus to create Nodes in significant places, and to nullify Paradox.

== Spirit
_Art of the Otherworlds_

Reaching into the essence beyond Earthly life and matter, the Spirit magus explores the Otherworlds and deals with creatures beyond mortal understanding. One of the most primal forms of the mystic Arts, Spirit Sphere magick traffics in the hidden side of the natural realm. As a result, its Effects typically use the Gauntlet Ratings to determine the difficulty of their associated rolls.

Often affiliated with the shaman, Spirit magick is more eclectic than it often appears. A magus who specializes in this Sphere could be a primal devotee, a sophisticated theologian, a medicine-worker deeply versed in cultural traditions, an eclectic metaphysician, a modern Pagan, or anyone else who comprehends the rich world beyond material physics. Almost inevitably, he will look deeper than most modern people do, grasping for the spiritual forces behind apparently mundane events.

For an optional Technocratic approach to Spirit, see Dimensional Science, pp. 525-526.

=== #spec_char.d4 Spirit Sight / Spirit Sense
To most of humanity, the spirit world remains invisible. Not to a magus who knows the Spirit Sphere. Although he'll be most attuned to spirits with Resonance similar to his own, that magus can read the local Gauntlet's thickness, discern auras, sense spirits of all types, peek into the Penumbra through the Vidare (see Chapters Three and Four), and determine whether or not a material object has a spiritual component (as mystic Fetishes do). 

Combined with other Spheres, that magus can spot forces, places, or items with unusual ties to the spirit world, such as Awakened objects, elemental spirits, possessed organisms, Shallowings, Nodes, and so forth.

=== #spec_char.d6 Touch Spirit / Manipulate Gauntlet
Perception moves to contact. The Spirit-savvy magus can now reach through the Gauntlet for a turn or two; call across the Gauntlet; speak to spirit entities, or touch them for a brief moment; and thin or thicken the local Gauntlet. That said, a human magus cannot lower the Gauntlet to less than #spec_char.d10 within the mortal world. 

By adding other Spheres, that magus could project thoughts across the barrier (Mind #spec_char.d10 or #spec_char.d12); stir up elemental disturbances within the Otherworlds (Forces #spec_char.d6 or higher); imbue material objects with ephemeral power (Matter #spec_char.d6); drain Essence from a spirit (Prime #spec_char.d8); or help other living creatures sense or contact the spirit realms (Life #spec_char.d6).

=== #spec_char.d8 Pierce Gauntlet / Step Sideways / Rouse & Lull Spirit
Now the magus can cross over, transmuting his living tissue to ephemera. He may carry a few material possessions, although transmuting them as well raises the difficulty of the roll. (Normal clothing and items step up the Gauntlet rating once; bulky clothing and items step up rating twice.) That traveler must step sideways on his own; bringing large items or other people across demands a higher Spirit Rank. Meanwhile, a combined Spirit #spec_char.d8/ Mind #spec_char.d6 Effect allows the magus to read Resonance, Synergy, and other spiritual energies (Essence, a spirit's place within a hierarchy, etc.). 

At this Rank, a mortal magus can also harm an Umbral entity as if they was using Life #spec_char.d8 against that entity. While Spirit #spec_char.d6 allows the magus to touch that entity, Spirit #spec_char.d8 lets him actually damage its ephemeral Pattern's integrity the way that Life #spec_char.d8 damages a physical creature's form.

By combining this Rank with Matter #spec_char.d8 and Prime #spec_char.d6, the magus can also create short-lived objects from ephemera; such creations must be constructed as if they were material things, and they fade away at the end of the Effect's duration. 

Finally, this Rank helps the magus rouse the slumbering spirits within objects or places, or else put active spirits to sleep. (See Awakening Substances in Chapter Nine, p. 443).

=== #spec_char.d10 Rend Gauntlet / Seal Breach / Bind Spirit
As the magus approaches Mastery, they can tear Gateways in the Gauntlet, allowing groups or large objects to pass through… or close such breaches, too. Both applications, of course, are deeply vulgar.

At this Rank, the magus may also compel spirits to appear, bind them into Fetish objects, or tie them to certain spots or prisons. For obvious reasons, such bondage is risky, especially if the spirit is powerful. A brave or foolish Spirit magus can even turn himself into a temporary Fetish, channeling a spirit entity into his mortal body; in such cases, they loses his ability to use true magick, but they may employ the capabilities of the spirit inside him. On the flipside, they can also exorcise a spirit that has possessed a mortal host. In all cases, the magus enters a series of resisted rolls against the spirit, pitting his Willpower against that spirit's own. 

=== #spec_char.d12 Forge Ephemera / Gilgul / Break the Dreamshell
The Spirit Master is now able to command ephemera itself, creating, challenging, and destroying spirit matter as they Wills. With such power, they may create Realms, imbue or drain a spirit of Essence, instill a soul within an empty shell of Life or Matter, and bestow the awful sentence of Gilgul -- the destruction of a magus's Avatar. Such powers are always vulgar and feature devastating consequences even when the magus succeeds. 

This power also allows the magus to break the Dreamshell and venture beyond the Horizons, wandering into the Deepest of Umbrae.

== Time
_Tricking the Flow_

The esoteric Arts of Time demand a flexible mindset. Possibly the most confounding Sphere, Time involves dizzying temporal metaphysics that defy the most apparently determined aspect of reality: time itself. Yet, initiates of this Sphere understand that time is fluid… difficult to manipulate, but not as rigid as it might appear.

In conjunction with other Spheres, Time allows a magus to set triggers on other Effects, stretch out their duration, see into other times and places, or otherwise warp the threads of time. When prolonging an Effect, she could either increase Duration, or else add Entropy #spec_char.d8 in order to hold the Effect until a certain circumstance occurs.

It has been said that time travel is impossible; however, that is not entirely true… it is just extremely difficult. Effects that involve going backwards in time are always vulgar, and stack the effects of Paradox. No wonder people who go back in time rarely return to speak of it!

As one might expect, a magus who manipulates the Time Sphere tends to appear distant from the moment at hand. Although she might have excellent timing, her sense of the importance of past/ present/ future events seems to be a bit more… fluid than usual for a person living by the clock in today's world.

=== #spec_char.d4 Time Sense
Temporal understanding begins with the magus's own perceptions of time. At this stage, she develops a precise internal clock and can spot the temporal ripples left behind by (or, in many cases, developing ahead of) Time Effects. Other phenomena, too, leave disturbances in the time-stream, and the magus can notice them as well. Combined with additional Spheres, this Rank allows the magus to detect the influence of the Time Sphere on other spells or Patterns too.

=== #spec_char.d6 Past & Future Sight Thicken the Walls of Time
Now the magus can look forward or backward through time. Although those impressions are fleeting, hazy, not entirely accurate, and bound by the limitations of that time and place (that is, what a bystander in that specific time and location could sense under the circumstances), they allow the Time-seer to catch glimpses of the past or future.

By itself, this Effect allows the magus to see in her present location only. By combining Past/ Future Sight with other Spheres, however, she could read the probable past or future impressions of objects or places (Matter), living things (Life), and alternate locations (Correspondence). Entropy #spec_char.d6 even allows her to glimpse multiple futures and pick out the one most likely to occur. 

Reversing her powers of perception, that same magus can thicken the walls of time, which makes other Time Effects more difficult.

=== #spec_char.d8 Time Contraction or Dilation / “Bullet Time” / Rewind Time 
Speeding or slowing her relationship with time, the magus can now gain multiple actions, slow other characters or phenomena, or rewind small snatches of time. Or else slow another character, object, or even herself.

By rewinding time, the magus can also move her immediate surroundings -- an Effect that pulls her out of the normal flow of time and allows her to retcon an action or two.

Combining this Rank with other Spheres, the magus can affect other Patterns (Forces, Life, or Matter #spec_char.d6), cast Effects across distance and time (Correspondence #spec_char.d8), move back in time while recalling events from the future she just left (Life #spec_char.d8/ Mind #spec_char.d4), or even invoke multiple probabilities (Entropy #spec_char.d8). Again, such attempts are Paradox magnets with awful long-term consequences.

=== #spec_char.d10 Time Determinism / Trigger Effect / Time Bubble / Anchor Point
Now the magus learns to withdraw herself from the normal flow of time, hold Effects until they are triggered by events, or -- by adding in Correspondence, Forces, Life, Matter, and/ or Spirit -- capture other beings or phenomena in bubbles of time. Thus, a mighty (vulgar) Time/ Forces/ Entropy Effect could capture a tornado and shunt it off into no-time space until some trigger sets it free. At this level of expertise, the magus can also set a temporal anchor point for herself for when she dares to travel through time at Rank #spec_char.d12.

=== #spec_char.d12 Temporal Travel/ Time Immunity
The “Dr. Who Effect” allows the magus to exist outside of time; immunize people, places or things from time's passage; or travel forward or backward through time. Such godlike feats… feats that often cause a magus to become forever lost to history… are often best left to the GM's discretion. Even for Masters, Time travel is a mysterious and maddeningly imprecise art. For extensive details about such things, see the sourcebook How Do You DO That?
