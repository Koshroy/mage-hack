## Character Creation

### Step 0: Get a character sheet
Todo.

### Step 1: Choose Distinctions
- One for your personality, or motivation;
- One for your Sleeper life;
- One for your affiliation with a Group of Magi.
  > Examples: A Hermetic Mage, A Verbena Witch, A NWO Agent…;

Each of your distinctions benefits from the Hinder SFX:

*Hinder:* Roll a d4 instead of a d8 for a distinction to earn 1 PP.

### Step 2: Assign Attributes
Each attribute defaults to d4 and you have 3, 5 and 7 points to step them up.

### Step 3: Assign Skills
Each Skill defaults to d4 and you have 15 points to step up skills. 

Maximum skill at character creation is d10.

As a general guide, 9 points represent what you learned from your Sleeper Life and 6 represent what you’ve learned since Awakening if you're playing a competent but young mage.

### Step 4: Spheres
You have 6 points to spend on sphere rating, starting on d4, maximum Sphere rating at character creation is d8.

At least one point must be assigned to Tradition’s affinity Sphere, to reflect your training in Tradition’s specialty.

### Step 5: Assign Specialties, Signature Assets, and additional Powers
Players have 9 points to spend on these options:
- One point to buy a Signature Asset;
- One point to step up a Signature Asset;
- One point to buy a Specialty;
- Two points to buy a new Power;
- Two points to step your Power up;
- Two points for a new SFX;

At character creation Signature Assets may not be larger than d8.

### Step 6: Assign universal SFX and Quintessence Pool
Write down universal SFX. Assign 2d6 to the Quintessence pool, this is your Quintessence pool size.
