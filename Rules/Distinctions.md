## Distinctions
Distinctions are a trait that represents a character’s background, personality, and role in the game and that differentiates them from other PCs and GMCs.

Each player has three Distinctions: Personality, Sleeper Life, Awakened Identity.

Distinctions are the first of your Prime Sets to be used in every roll and are rated at <spc>⑧</spc>.

### Personality
Who is your character? What are they at their core? What motivates them?

The personality distinction defines your core personality and concept in one short phrase.

### Sleeper Life
Before you Awakened, you were someone, you had a job, were studying or trying to just get by. Describe your Sleeper side, what still remains of your Sleeper past.

### Awakened Identity
After you Awakened you changed, a truth of the world opened up to you, you now belong to a group of other Awakened or you are fending for your own, you have a method to your magick or it is a chaotic collection of random knowledge that somehow works. Be it as it may, magick is now an inherent part of you.
